Uses of socket APIs

2 types of sockets

1. Connection oriented.
2. Connectionless oriented.

In a connectionless protocol, such as UDP, each data packet is addressed individually.

From the protocol's perspective, each data packet is completely independent and unrelated to any packets coming before or after it.
